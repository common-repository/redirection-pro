== Description ==

Redirection PRO is a plugin that enhances your WordPress website by fetching and displaying the link preview for each external link. It also creates a gateway for redirection that informs the user that they are leaving your website. It helps you improve the SEO performance of your website by preventing the user from opening broken external links through your website. This way, you can avoid losing traffic and ranking due to 404 errors and bad user experience.

== Key Features ==

1. Open Graph Data: Redirection PRO adds Open Graph data to external links, including image, description, and destination page title. It also includes site URL and name. This information can be utilized in JavaScript code by calling the dataset property.

2. Link Preview: Redirection PRO adds a customizable popover to external links, allowing users to preview Open Graph data. The popover comes with multiple themes, providing an interactive and engaging experience for visitors.

3. Redirection Features: Redirection PRO brings advanced redirection capabilities to your website. You can configure a redirection page with a countdown timer, ensuring a smooth transition for users before redirecting them to external links.

4. External Link Replacement: Redirection PRO offers a comprehensive external link replacement system, helping website owners prevent robots from detecting external links. It also provides link obfuscation to completely hide the destination URL. It's important to enable the Open Graph preview feature to ensure client safety.

5. Destination Header Checker: With Redirection PRO, you can prevent users from being redirected to broken links. The plugin adds the "broken" attribute to links, allowing you to easily identify and handle broken destinations.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Q: Is replacing external links bad for SEO?
   A: While robots check pages for valuable content, if the destination site changes (resulting in broken links), it can lead to a reduction in rank. Therefore, it is advisable to use other SEO practices to improve site SEO instead of solely relying on external links. Additionally, the plugin provides a URL filter to exclude trusted domains from the URL replacement process.

2. Q: Does this plugin increase page load time?
   A: No, Redirection PRO implements a powerful cache system. The cache system stores loaded data from the destination URL for a certain period of time, reducing the need for repeated requests and enhancing performance. Furthermore, the plugin optimizes load timeouts on the server-side to minimize waiting times.

3. Q: Why do I need this plugin?
   A: This plugin is particularly useful when dealing with external links to unknown or personal blogs. It helps ensure your website remains unaffected by unpredictable changes in destination URLs. Furthermore, you can utilize this plugin to prioritize client safety and protect them from reaching unwanted destinations.

4. Q: What should I consider while using this plugin?
   A: It's important to note that this plugin can have an impact on your website's SEO ranking. As such, consider using other practices to optimize your SEO instead of relying solely on external links. The plugin allows you to exclude trusted websites from the link replacement process, enabling you to strike a balance between SEO optimization and link management.
